<p> <a href="https://www.apple.com/kr/mac/" target="_blank" title="Mac">The Macintosh.</a>  (pronounced as /ˈmækɪnˌtɒʃ/ MAK-in-tosh; branded as Mac since 1998) is a family of personal computers designed, manufactured, and sold by Apple Inc. since January 1984.
  The original Macintosh was the company's first mass-market personal computer that featured a graphical user interface, built-in screen and mouse.
  Apple sold the Macintosh alongside its popular Apple II family of computers for almost ten years before they were discontinued in 1993.</p>
